Attach/Mount New Disk to the VM

1.	Go to the Azure portal to find the VM. Search for and select Virtual machines.

2.	Choose the VM from the list.

3.	In the Virtual machines page, under Settings, choose Disks.

4.	On the Disks pane, under Data disks, select Create and attach a new disk.

5.	Enter a name for your managed disk. Review the default settings, and update the Storage type, Size (GiB), Encryption and Host caching as necessary. 

6.	When you are done, select Save at the top of the page to create the managed disk and update the VM configuration.

7.	Connect to the VM to mount the new disk.

8.	Once connected to your VM, you need to find the disk. In this example, we are using lsblk to list the disks.
        lsblk -o NAME,HCTL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT | grep -i "sd"
        In this example, the disk that I added is sdc. It is a LUN 0 and is 10GB.

9.	Partition the New Disk
        sudo parted /dev/sdc --script mklabel gpt mkpart xfspart xfs 0% 100%
        sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/sdc1
        sudo partprobe /dev/sdc1

10.	Mount the Disk
        Create a directory to mount the file system using mkdir. 
        The following example creates a directory at /datadrive:
        sudo mkdir /datadrive

11.     Use mount to then mount the filesystem. 
        The following example mounts the /dev/sdc1 partition to the /datadrive mount point:
        sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /datadrive
        df

12.     To ensure that the drive is remounted automatically after a reboot, it must be added to the /etc/fstab file. 
        It is also highly recommended that the UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is used in /etc/fstab to refer to the drive rather than just the device name (such as, /dev/sdc1). 
        If the OS detects a disk error during boot, using the UUID avoids the incorrect disk being mounted to a given location.
        Remaining data disks would then be assigned those same device IDs. 
        To find the UUID of the new drive, use the blkid utility:
        sudo blkid 

13.     Next, open the /etc/fstab file in a text editor as follows:
        sudo nano /etc/fstab
        
        In this example, use the UUID value for the /dev/sdc1 device that was created in the previous steps, and the mountpoint of /datadrive. 
        Add the following line to the end of the /etc/fstab file:

        UUID=40ea8f38-ab53-4d60-b220-c76365c19766   /datadrive   xfs   defaults,nofail   1   2

        We used the nano editor, so when you are done editing the file, use Ctrl+O to write the file and Ctrl+X to exit the editor.

14.     Verify the Disk
        You can now use lsblk again to see the disk and the mountpoint. 
        lsblk -o NAME,HCTL,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT | grep -i "sd"
        You can see that sdc is now mounted at /datadrive.
