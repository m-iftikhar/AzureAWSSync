You can not access AWS CodeCommit Repos with your AWS Root Account so we need to create an IAM user. 

Create CodeCommit repo with Root user. 

Now Create IAM user and Assign Administrator Access to the user. 

Now login from your IAM user account. 

Place SSh public key in the IAM User SSh key section and copy the SSh key ID for later use. 

go to you .ssh folder and create a file named config with the following configs: 
Host git-codecommit.*.amazonaws.com
User Your-IAM-SSH-Key-ID-Here
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/Your-Private-Key-File-Name-Here

now go to repository and copy ssh url to clone the repo.
